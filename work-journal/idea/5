## [active] [5] Fix Charge
When charge is activated, the player could already be in motion,
therefore the speed will not be applied until the next path action
is created. This break fluidity and the feedback to the player
about the skill activating is de-synced. To fix this the client
needs to be prepared to handle path actions that have changed. The
server needs to rebuild the path action if charge is activated when
a path action already exists. This may be a difficult problem and
still may not feel very fluid to use.
