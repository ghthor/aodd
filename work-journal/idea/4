## [inactive] [4] Fix Assail
I need something that represents a frame of a path action.
The use case is for assail. The current implementation uses
the actor's cell and facing to spawn the assail entity in
the adjacent cell directly in front of the actor. This is
all well and good, unless the actor is moving. The way to
solve this is to take into account the actor's movement
and to create an entity that spans the 2 cells in front of
the actor, both representing a percentage of the cell. These
2 percentages add up to 100%, which means it still represents
the same area as a cell, it's just offset from the discrete
grid.
