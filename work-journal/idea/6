## [inactive] [6] Low Hanging Fruit
Neither of these issues are showing up the in the current round of
performance testing which is being dominated by the world state diff
calculations. Regardless, the following are both still good low hanging
fruits and the runtime.mallocgc and runtime.scanobject are also showing
up in the cpu profiles so I'll need to look into better allocation
in the near future.

- Reusing the arrays allocated during the broad phase.
- Checking whether entities should collide during the broad phase.
    - aka. A collision should not be generated for an actor AND it's own assail
