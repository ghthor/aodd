## [inactive] [3] Major Bugs
### Client Side

- [ ] Actor's viewport overlapping edge of world
    - Causes invalid index access while merging diffs
    - [Current Hack] Can be avoided by bounding the actors ability to move
      to a point where their viewport overlaps the edge of the world

### Server Side

- [ ] Actor's can walk out of the world
    - The entity is removed and I believe the server panic's and dies
    - [Current Hack] Can be avoided by bounding the actors
      movement from ever reaching the edge of the world
