# Checking back in
I've been hacking away at a bot and doing some performance testing.
Found some deadlocking bugs from using the bot to load actors into the game.
Playing with the bot has identified some ugly edges of my WorldStateDiff implementation
that is causing some serious performance issues.
Each actor having a WorldState and calculating the diff serverside before sending
the state is causing lots of repeated work per actor that needs to be somehow cached
so the diff calculations are only done once per server tick instead of N times where
N is the number of actors where the viewport contains the same entity.
